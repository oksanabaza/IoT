This proposal presents a project centered around Raspberry Pi, designed to develop a Smart Plant Monitoring System. The objective is to offer users a user-friendly and effective method for overseeing and nurturing their plants' well-being through a centralized platform. This system finds utility both in professional settings like Botanical Gardens and in domestic environments, allowing users to monitor humidity levels near their plants. The outcomes of this monitoring process will be promptly relayed to the user's device, accompanied by actionable messages.

## Tools, Technologies and Equipment
Protocols/Devices:
MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport): Utilized for efficient communication between the Raspberry Pi and connected sensors, enabling real-time data exchange.

Sensor: Raspberry Pi Sensor Board to measure humidity

Programming Language: Python

Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Visual Studio Code

Cloud Platform: AWS IoT
